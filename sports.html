<h2>Doing Depictions Right: How One Team respectfully Depicts an Ethnicity</h2>
<p id="paragraph1"> Mascots and native americans have a bitter history of disrespectful representation of culture. From the washingon Red Skins, to Land o' Lakes Butter. 
  Even local figures, like the "Hays High Indians" hold either offensive naming, or tastless caricatures. However, there is one mascot out there
that has a group of people as a masot, but does not disrespect an entire race, that mascot belongs to
<a href="https://www.nhl.com/blackhawks" target="_blank">The Chicago Blackhawks</a>.  </p>

<p id="sports-article">The Blackhawks are an NHL team that understands what a mascots visual should be. the mascot is that of a specific tribe of Native Americans, 
  unlike teams that use an entire race/racial slur as a mascot (ask yourself if you would be okay with a team called "The Asians"). While also maintaining a semi respetful visual image.
  a problem almost all native mascots have, where the character will be either a literal red skinned feather wearing native warrior, or a white Elmer Fudd type character wearing 
  stereotypical native garb. The Black Hawks mascot is of human skintone, with simple hair decorations, and face paint.With even discussion of changing the mascot to a literal
  hawk, where the native clothing items are represented via cloration in the hawk's feathers. The Blackhawks are a team that understand what it means to use a name and a mascot, and understands what 
  lines are not to be crossed.

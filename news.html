        <p id="article">Kansas's stay at home order, put in place due to the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, has officially allowed businesses to open their doors and lobbies as of May 3rd.
          allowing for people to be within close proximity of one another once more. To the dismay of many kansas citizens. 
        </p>

        <p id="article2">The current number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in kansas is 5458. increasing by approximately 1000 since April, gaining 273 cases on May 5th. 
          With nearly 150 fatalities, leading people to believe that the stay at home order should be extended. Whether or not the order will be reinstated is yet to be seen.
          Regardless, the WHO stll recommends maintaining social distancing, and to continue wearing facial protection.
